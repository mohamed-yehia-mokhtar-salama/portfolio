# Portfolio of Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my projects across various domains of data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics. Each folder contains a range of projects that demonstrate my skills and work in these areas.

## Folder Structure

- **Data Science**  
  This folder contains projects focused on data science, including tasks such as data preprocessing, machine learning model development, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal of these projects is to extract insights from data and build predictive models.

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
  Here, you'll find projects that explore artificial intelligence techniques, such as deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning. These projects involve the application of advanced algorithms to solve complex problems.

- **Data Analytics**  
  This folder features projects centered around data analytics, including data visualization, statistical analysis, and business intelligence. These projects aim to transform raw data into meaningful insights to support decision-making and strategic planning.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in various projects:

- **Python**: For data analysis, machine learning, and AI.
- **R**: For statistical analysis and data visualization.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For deep learning and AI-related projects.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **SQL**: For working with relational databases.
